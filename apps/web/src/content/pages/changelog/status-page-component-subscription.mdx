Subscribers can now choose exactly which components they want to receive notifications for on a status page.

Instead of getting every update, subscribers can opt into specific components - like only the API, or only the EU region. When a status report or maintenance affects a component they care about, they get notified. Everything else stays quiet.

- **Per-component subscriptions** - select individual components or entire groups
- **Manage anytime** - update your subscription scope from the status page via your unique link
- **Backwards compatible** - existing subscribers continue to receive all updates unless they customize their scope
